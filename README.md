# Planet-Selling-Site
The Planet Selling Website is a web-based platform designed to showcase and "sell" 3D models of various planets in our solar system. This project is aimed at demonstrating fundamental web development skills and includes interactive features that allow users to explore different planets and view their details.
This website allows users to explore various planets and provides information about each one. The "Buy Now" functionality and some additional features are placeholders for future development, as this project is primarily for learning purposes.
